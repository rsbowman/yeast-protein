# Semisupervised learning with TILO/PRC

This is the code to accompany the paper *An application of topological
graph clustering to protein function prediction* by R. Sean Bowman,
Douglas Heisterkamp, Jesse Johnson, and Danielle O'Donnol.  To use it,
you'll need [scikit-learn][1] and the python bindings to the
[TILO/PRC C++ library][2].

The data in the paper was generated with the script `make_paper_data.py`.
